This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel


The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## A short note on your approach and thought process
-> 1.First, I kicked off by setting up a solid foundationâ€”using hooks and state to let users add, update, and delete tasks, making the UI feel alive and    interactive.
   2. Then, I spiced it up with a theme toggle and filter/sort/search features, giving you that extra flexibility to play around with.
   3.For the sidebar, I threw in a ref with a click-outside logic, and styled it with CSS variables or inline styles to keep things neat.
     Lastly, I blended Tailwind with custom CSS to make it responsive and smooth
